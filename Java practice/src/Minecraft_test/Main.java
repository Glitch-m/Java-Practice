        *
        *  Create a custom class and connect it to the main class
        *  Make sure that when you Run the code you can make a Java collection, interfaces & Polymorphism classes
        *  Create a custom statement within these classes and complete the code of the other classes for the main class to work.
        *
        *  primary objective is to make a Java collection with a proper name. The name we will use for this class will be called "The_minecraft_Game"
        *  The Second class that supports the first class will be called "The_Minecraft_Config"
        *
        *  The "The_minecraft_Config" Class will be used to set up print out statements for the main class. By the time we finish the Code
        *  The main class will have a code that says "The_Minecraft_Game game = new The_minecraft_Game"
        *  Hopefully This will succeed.
